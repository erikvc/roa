				  <p class="optmedia-aboutus-header">Our History</p>
				  <p>On September 15, 1950, Rev. Thomas H. Wade Sr., opened the doors of Rock of Ages Baptist Church in the Old Lycem Hall located at 1309 Madison Street in Maywood, with two members - his wife and his son. Even with its meager start the church was destined for greatness because it began with the right purpose and passion - to reach out to the least in society, reclaim the lost to Christ, and comfort the downtrodden in spirit. Rock of Ages experienced great growth under the leadership of Rev. Wade, and eventually moved into another church edifice at 1642 S. 15th Avenue in Maywood.</p>
				  <p>Shortly after Rev. Wade passed away, the Lord sent another visionary to carry on His vision for the Church. Rev. Marvin E. Wiley brought a new and youthful spark to Rock of Ages Baptist Church. As a result, the membership increased at a phenomenal rate. In 1995, a new multi-million dollar edifice was built at the original location of the Old Lycem recognized in the community as an organization that effectively ministers to the Spiritual, Emotional, financial, physical, and social needs of the community. Since Pastor Wiley&rsquo;s installation, membership at Rock of Ages has grown from 400 to more than 4,000 and Vision of Restoration, Inc. (VOR) a 501(c)3 organization - was founded to restore the broken lives of residents in Maywood and surroudning communities. In October 2003, the ministry expanded to include a Saturday night worship in Bolingbrook, IL to meet the needs of members and residents in the western suburban areas of Chicago. Under Pastor Wiley&rsquo;s leadership, the T.H. Wade Foundation Center, a four level, multi-million dollar facility opened Thanksgiving Day 2004. This new 40,000 sq. feet edifice offers many additional resources for training, education, and businesses.</p>

				  <p class="optmedia-aboutus-header">What We Believe?</p>
				  
				  <p>This Church accepts the Scriptures as the revealed Will of God, the all-sufficient rule of faith and practice, and for the purpose of maintaining general unity, has adopted these statements of Fundamental Truths and Doctrine. The Scriptures Inspired - The Bible is the inspired Word of God, a revelation from God to man, the infallible rule of faith and conduct, and is superior to conscience and reason, but not contrary to reason (II Timothy 3:15-17; I Peter 1:23-35; Hebrews 4:12).</p>
				  <p>The One True Godhead The triune Godhead is comprised of three separate and distinct personalities, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who are eternally self-existent, self-revealed and functions as one entity. Jesus Christ, who is God manifested in the flesh, is the second member of the Godhead, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit.</p>
				  <p>The Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ The Lord Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God. The scriptures declares: His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31,35); His sinless life (Hebrews 7:26; I Peter 2:22) His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38); His substitution work on the cross (I Corinthians 15:3; II Corinthians 5:21); His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; I Corinthians 15:4); His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9; 2:33; Philippines 2:9-11; Hebrews 1:3).</p>
				  <p>The Fall of Man Man was created good and upright; for God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby incurred not only physical death, but spiritual death, which is separation from God (Genesis 1:26-27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12-19).</p>
				  <p>The Salvation of Man Man's only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ. On the cross Jesus Christ became sin and sickness providing both salvation and divine healing for all mankind, (Psalms 103:3) being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. For by grace we are saved through faith. "The Word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation" (Romans 3:24; Ephesians 2:8; Romans 10:8-10).</p>
				  <p>The Evidence of Salvation The inward evidence, to the believer of his salvation, is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans 8:16). The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness. "And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us" (I John 3:23).</p>
				  <p>Faith and Works Salvation is by faith in Jesus Christ and not by human works; however, our works will determine the rewards in eternity (Acts 16:3; Romans 10:9-10; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-7; Romans 14:12-20; and II Corinthians 5:10).</p>

				  <p id="u119985-61">Our Mission Statement is "Ministering to the Misery of the Masses with the Mercy of the Master." "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" (Matthew 9:35 NIV).</p>
				  <p id="u119985-64">Ministering We believe that if we are going to have an impact on the Maywood and global community we will have to do so through meaningful ministry. We are mandated to minister to those who are suffering from the ravages of sin, Satan, and self. Our plan is to truly become a mega-ministering ministry. We are told in Ephesians 4:29c that we are to "....minister grace to the hearer."</p>
				  <p id="u119985-67">Misery We sense strongly a need to meet the needs of those who are facing misery and miserable situations. Even though we understand that life holds for all of us some seasonal situations, we want to be there to see people through. The world is filled with people who are facing unemployment, financial difficulties, sickness, mental stress, discouragement, bereavement, addictions, and more that can be classified as misery. There is no corner of the world where misery is not found. It is not relegated to one color, sex, or religious belief. Misery is everywhere. We are told in Ecclesiastes 8:6 that the "misery of the man is great upon the earth."</p>
				  <p id="u119985-70">Masses Even though our target group is the world we have narrowed it down to our homes, neighborhood, community, city, state, nation, and world. We hear and heed the commandment of God to "go into all the world..." Everywhere we go we want to share the love of Christ through telling the world about it. People matter to us because they matter to God. We are told in Matthew 9:36a that "...when Jesus saw the multitude; he was moved with compassion on them..."</p>
				  <p id="u119985-73">Mercy We are ever mindful that it had not been for the mercy of God we would be unsaved today. Because mercy has been given to us we also share that same mercy as we minister to others who are in need. We are called to be conduits of mercy and we know that we will never be truly successful as a church until we show the mercy of God to everyone we meet. In Romans 11:31c, we read these words: "...that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy."</p>
				  <p id="u119985-76">Master Jesus the Christ is the pattern for all that we do. His Word and good works as documented by the Bible is our guide as we seek those who are facing the pains, problems, and perils of life. Our ultimate aim is to bring people to Christ while keeping in mind that for some it may take longer than others. For some the love will shed abroad immediately but for others the light will not shine for years. Jesus is our Master and we are committed to the things that are important to Him. In John 13:13 we read: "Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well: for so I am."</p>

				  <p class="optmedia-aboutus-header">Vision Statement</p>
				  
				  <p id="u119985-83">Our Vision Statement is, "We believe God has given us the vision to become compassionate Christians who are empowered by Christ to reach beyond the walls of the Church building to meet the holistic needs of our community."</p>
				  <p id="u119985-86">God has been working through Pastor Marvin E. Wiley since March 1991 to manifest the vision He has set forth for Rock of Ages Baptist Church. Since the Church's inception of September 15, 1950, under the leadership of its initial Pastor, Dr. Thomas H. Wade Sr., the Church has grown spiritually and numerically.</p>
				  <p id="u119985-89">In 1995, God gave Pastor Wiley the vision to build a new edifice to his glory at 1309 Madison Street. Thereafter, Vision of Restoration a 501c3, T. H. Wade Foundation Center, Solid Rock Christian Bookstore, and the Rock Solid Ice Cream Shop were acquired.</p>
				  <p id="u119985-92">Under the direction and leadership of Pastor Wiley, the Church is again positioning itself for expansion, increased opportunities to minister and reach the lost. As members we are co-laborers and partners with the Pastor. Every member will be needed to receive the vision, understand the vision, and share the vision. We believe the best is yet to come. As the Pastor would say, "Don't let us be successful without you." Be a part of the success for Christ!</p>

				  <p class="optmedia-aboutus-header">Ordinances of the Church</p>
				  
				  <p id="u119985-99">Baptism in Water The ordinance of baptism by a burial with Christ should be observed as commanded in the Scriptures by all who have really repented and in their hearts have truly believed on Christ as Savior and Lord. In so doing, they declare to the world that they have died with Jesus and that they have also been raised with him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Acts 10:47-48; Romans 6:4).</p>
				  <p id="u119985-102">The Lord's Supper (Holy Communion) "And when He had given thanks he broke it, and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way also he took the cup, after supper saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often you drink it, in remembrance of me. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup" (1 Corinthians 11:24, 25, 28).</p>
				  <p id="u119985-105">Sanctification is a progressive act of separation from that which is evil and of dedication unto God (Romans 12:1-2; Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12). The Scriptures teach a life of holiness "without which no man shall see the Lord&rdquo; (Hebrews 12:14). By the power of the Holy Spirit we are able to obey the command: "Be ye holy for I am holy" (1 Peter 1:15-16).</p>
				  <p id="u119985-108">The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit with divine appointments for the fulfillment of her great commission. Each believer born of the Spirit is an integral part of the general assembly and Church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven (Ephesians 1:22-23; 2:22; Hebrews 12:23).</p>
				  <p id="u119985-111">The Ministry A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord for a two – fold purpose: (1) The evangelization of the world, (2) the edifying of the body of the Christ through the maturing and training of believers for ministry (Mark 16:15-20; Ephesians 4:11-12).</p>
				  <p id="u119985-114">The Blessed Hope The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the imminent and blessed hope of the Church (1 Thessalonians 4:16,17; Romans 8:23; Titus 2:13; 1 Corinthians 15:51,52).</p>
				  <p id="u119985-117">The Final Judgment There will be a final judgment in which the wicked who are dead will be raised and judged according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together with the Devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to everlasting punishment in the lake of fire which is the second death. (Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:43-48; Revelation 19:20; 20:10-15; 21:8).</p>
